# hello-world
First of his kind

Alone in the sight of moon, I’m eating a cup of froyo.
My only purpose this night is to just be there, being nothing but a couch potato.
Be my guest, sit down beside me and let’s go toghether to no land.

We’ll let our souls sing and dance till morning.
Because life is no more and we do not have to worry about that again.

Hey you!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
The first train to awareness is leaving.
You’ve got to hurry.
